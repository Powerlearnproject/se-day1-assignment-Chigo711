This event highlighted the growing complexity of software development and the need for systematic approaches to manage it, leading to the establishment of software engineering as a distinct discipline.
2) The Waterfall Model (1970s): The introduction of the Waterfall Model by Winston W. Royce provided a structured approach to software development, emphasizing sequential phases: requirements, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance. This model laid the groundwork for many methodologies used in software development.
3) Agile Manifesto (2001): The Agile Manifesto revolutionized software development by promoting flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback over rigid planning. It introduced iterative processes and adaptive planning, allowing teams to respond quickly to changing requirements and deliver high-quality software more efficiently.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Ans: 
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) consists of several key phases that guide the development process from conception to deployment and maintenance. Hereâ€™s a brief explanation of each phase:
1) Planning: This initial phase involves defining the scope, objectives, and feasibility of the project. Stakeholders identify requirements and create a project plan, including timelines and resources needed.
2) Requirements Analysis: In this phase, detailed requirements are gathered from stakeholders. This includes functional requirements (what the software should do) and non-functional requirements (how the software should perform). This information serves as the foundation for design.
3) Design: The software architecture and design are created based on the requirements. This phase outlines how the software will function, including user interfaces, system interfaces, data structures, and algorithms.
4) Implementation (Coding): During this phase, developers write the actual code based on the design specifications. This is where the software is built and integrated into a working system.
5) Testing: After coding, the software undergoes rigorous testing to identify and fix bugs or issues. Various testing methods (unit testing, integration testing, system testing) are employed to ensure quality and functionality.
6) Deployment: Once testing is complete, the software is deployed to a production environment for users. This phase may involve installation, configuration, and user training.
7) Maintenance: After deployment, the software enters the maintenance phase, where it is monitored and updated as necessary. This includes fixing bugs, making enhancements, and ensuring compatibility with new technologies.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Ans: 
1) Waterfall Methodology:
Definition: A linear and sequential approach to software development where each phase must be completed before moving to the next.
Phases: Typically include requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
Characteristics:
Rigid structure.
Emphasizes thorough documentation.
Changes are difficult to implement once a phase is completed.
Examples of Appropriate Scenarios:
Regulated Industries: Projects in industries like healthcare or finance, where strict compliance and documentation are required.
Clear Requirements: When project requirements are well understood and unlikely to change, such as developing a simple internal tool.

2) Agile Methodology:
